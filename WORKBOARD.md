# WORKBOARD

Status: Phase 5 — B1a/B1b/B2 and C1a/C1b are complete. C2 is active: its directory-owned room-authority publication and room-create continuity foundation are implemented, fully verified, and manually approved through `3cfaf4b`; retained invite custody, controller/UI activation, and packaged verification remain incomplete.

Purpose: route the asynchronous Rust reimplementation without duplicating its contracts.

## Active work

- Owner: [`docs/specs/human-invite-admission-session-slice.md`](docs/specs/human-invite-admission-session-slice.md)
- Completed prerequisite: [`docs/specs/asset-custody-lifecycle-slice.md`](docs/specs/asset-custody-lifecycle-slice.md)
- Downstream owner: [`docs/specs/room-settings-preferences-appearance-slice.md`](docs/specs/room-settings-preferences-appearance-slice.md)
- Architecture: [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)
- Real-client verification: [`docs/VERIFICATION.md`](docs/VERIFICATION.md)
- Comparison baseline: original `d5046473010d1353a81ee38337360e6d98f7bd6f`; verified public Rust implementation baseline `fdb4e49`; pushed, fully verified, and manually approved B2 baseline `2b97a7c`.
- Active gate: C2's post-ticket dispatch fences, monotonic publication/continuity owner, strict directory association, and linear frozen manager map are approved by the web session and Daybreaker with C/H/M 0/0/0. Retained invite custody, controller/UI cutover, and packaged activation remain incomplete pending their own implementation and reviews. The reviewed order is recorded in the active owner above.
- Required order: connect the copied frontend through the implemented exact desktop manager-invite grants to the create/revoke routes, then complete packaged frontend activation before continuing with appearance. Update the exposure map only after a surface is reachable and verified.
- Exit: local and remote humans reach preferences through their real authority owner, appearance uses its complete asset lifecycle, incomplete adjacent surfaces remain visibly unavailable, and mandatory gates, packaged frontend flows, cross-reviews, and verification cleanup pass.
