# WORKBOARD

Status: Phase 5 — B1a/B1b/B2 and C1a/C1b are complete. C2 is locally complete and its packaged matrix is verified; room appearance persistence and local/remote HTTP boundaries are verified while desktop/frontend activation remains incomplete.

Purpose: route the asynchronous Rust reimplementation without duplicating its contracts.

## Active work

- Owner: [`docs/specs/human-invite-admission-session-slice.md`](docs/specs/human-invite-admission-session-slice.md)
- Completed prerequisite: [`docs/specs/asset-custody-lifecycle-slice.md`](docs/specs/asset-custody-lifecycle-slice.md)
- Downstream owner: [`docs/specs/room-settings-preferences-appearance-slice.md`](docs/specs/room-settings-preferences-appearance-slice.md)
- Architecture: [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)
- Real-client verification: [`docs/VERIFICATION.md`](docs/VERIFICATION.md)
- Comparison baseline: original `d5046473010d1353a81ee38337360e6d98f7bd6f`; verified public Rust implementation baseline `fdb4e49`; pushed, fully verified, and manually approved B2 baseline `2b97a7c`.
- Active gate: the batch since reviewed baseline `10c63b4` exceeded 2,000 aggregate changed lines after real TCP appearance-session verification. Push and cross-review that exact batch before desktop/frontend appearance activation continues.
- Review cadence: commit each independent change below 1,000 changed lines; push and cross-review at three completed product features or 2,000 aggregate insertions plus deletions, whichever comes first.
- Required order: close the current batched review, then implement and package-verify typed desktop issuance plus the copied frontend object-URL lifecycle. Update the exposure map only after that surface is reachable and verified.
- Exit: local and remote humans reach preferences through their real authority owner, appearance uses its complete asset lifecycle, incomplete adjacent surfaces remain visibly unavailable, and mandatory gates, packaged frontend flows, cross-reviews, and verification cleanup pass.
